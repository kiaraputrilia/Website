   <li class='black'><a href='mailto:info@dextersinister.org'>By: kiaraputrilia@gmail.com</a> 
        <br><br>
	<li>If this is truly going to be a documentation<font color="#FF00FF"><sup>1</sup></font> of my learning process, then what better way to show how I’m learning to cook with a beginner’s mind?<font color="#FF00FF"><sup>2</sup></font></li>
	<li>One thing about me—I am extremely influenced by other people’s passions. It was only through watching certain people in my life maneuver in the kitchen that it made me want to love cooking. Their laborious, flavor-profiling, and meticulous process became akin to art-making. Even plating presentation reminded me of structure within grids and layouts when it comes to (information/graphic) design. I think it’s safe to say that I’ve been slowly pivoting away from cooking for the sake of sustenance. When life frees up more slow time, cooking has become meditative, and only through practicing more, do I become more familiarized and comfortable with different ingredients and techniques. </li>
	<br>
    <p class="shifted">Note: I started constructing this website on March 19, 2023, and I never intended it for it to be a “food (process) blog”. I wanted to catalog my experience with pasta-making, but this has led me to go through my photos and recall the times where I enjoyed cooking (and learned a thing or two) with friends and family.</p>
	<li>When navigating this site, listed events that are highlighted in <font color="#FF8C00">orange</font> are all things pasta, (because as I mentioned, this was my initial intention). Whereas all of my other food explorations are depicted in <font color="blue">blue</font>. Visuals featured within each listed event are accessible by clicking each button. The asterisk is a way for me to explore the intersections between these individual cooking experiences. Certain references and recipes show up in different events, and I track these interwoven connections with a &#10036;.

    <a href='http://archivesnartichokes.cargo.site/' style='background-color:#FF0;'>&nbsp;One of the many things that interest<font color="#FF00FF"><sup>3</sup></font> me is categorizing certain memory associations, (as you can tell from this website). If you're interested in my other (ongoing) projects, you can read about it here.&nbsp;</a></li>
