        <p>Ella and Mama Laurie were the two people who taught me how to cook, and I will forever cherish these memories! I didn't take a lot of pictures, but they both cooked <a href="https://barefootcontessa.com/recipes/chicken-marbella-updated">Chicken Marbella</a><font color="#FF00FF"><sup>1</sup></font> for dinner during one of the nights I stayed there. They also showed me a neat lil trick if I'm too tired to cook: cooking chicken fillet thighs with this <a href="https://www.fronterafoods.com/skillet-sauces">sauce</a><font color="#FF00FF"><sup>2</sup></font>.
        During one of those dinners, we ate arugula with sliced apples as a salad<font color="#FF00FF"><sup>3</sup></font> and it made me think about certain ingredient availabilities around the world, which I somehow didn't realize till then. During the last morning of my stay at Ella's, she taught me how to make biscuits.</p>
