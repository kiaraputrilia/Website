        <br>Which is, naturally, only going to grow longer than it is going to get shorter<font color="red">...dun..dun..dun..<em>*existential crisis*</em>...<em>*nature of mortality*</em>..dun..dun..dun..</font>  
        <br><br>I have too many scattered lists, which has been a working system so far, but maybe I'll have more fun with this! I mostly purchase secondhand books when it comes to novels from <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/">here.</a> 
        But, you can also check out this <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/">site,</a> aaaaaand <a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/">this site.</a>
        I also have a few resources on my are.na channel of (1) articles/pdf. readings that you can find here: <a href="https://www.are.na/kiara-putrilia/brain-fuel-hn2offzltmq">Brain Fuel</a> and online bookstores: <a href="https://www.are.na/kiara-putrilia/online-shelf">Online Shelf</a>.
                
        <br><br>Okay, now! Before you peruse through my reading list, there is one that I'd love for you to read. (<em>Clicking on the title starts an automatic download</em>) It's my annotated copy of <a href="https://kiaraputrilia.github.io/Website/ReadingList/Masha.pdf" download><em>Like Someone in Love An Addendum to Love Song</em> by Masha Tupitsyn.</a> 
        
        My professor gave this out as an assigned reading back in February 2023, but I haven't stopped thinking about it! You can definitely skip this part of me rambling <font color="green">(but if you love hearing me ramble some more then do check out my <a href="https://www.archivesnartichokes.cargo.site">website</a>)</font>
        about it but here are my two cents on it: 
        <font color="Fuchsia">In the past few months, I have really taken a liking to the nature of websites and their endless hyperlinks—jumping from one platform to another, from text to video, from song to text, from text to more text, (and the list of possibilities goes on). It’s as if we’re constantly traversing from one stream of thought to another, where everything is interwoven. The reading experience of Like Someone in Love: An Addendum to Love Dog, felt exactly just like that. But beyond that, we also feel like this great passage of time. The reading is interestingly structured into two columns which sometimes become a space for juxtaposing her own retelling of her life and other outside references of text, sound, and images. As I was reading through it, I found myself treating her text as hyperlinks—highlighting passages I love and highlighting names of her other references that she incorporated into her text. This document turned into multiple browser windows. And yet, It feels like a handwritten digital archive, (though I know both those words together are antithetical to each other). Masha’s inclusion of other people’s words is imbued into her own, almost like she then started to “own” them too, which I think is the case for a lot of us when we jot down quotes and bookmark images. Perhaps, other people’s words can better explain our feelings—Masha best explained this on page 35; her obsession with words and seeking the truth from them. The differing quantitive entries are reflective of her thoughts, where sometimes she simply includes a quote and/or an image that felt sufficient enough to understand how she was feeling that day.</font>

                <font color="Fuchsia">hmm..interesting..as I'm writing this list down I'm wondering about two things: (1) Should I color-code these books between novels and art/design books? Or is that too much work? hmm.. I'll think about it more. (2) Should I include all the books I've read in this list too?</font>
                <li>Face to Face: Interviews with Artists by Richard Cork</li>

                <li>The Heptameron by Marguerite de Navarre</li>
                <font color="blue">Yes, this is totally on my list because it was featured in Call Me By Your Name. I really do love it when books and movies reference other books. yes kiara..very meta.</font>
                <li>Cinta itu Luka/Beauty is a Wound by Eka Kurniawan</li>
                <font color="Fuchsia">I'm surprised I didn't include this at the very top of my list. BUT, I purchased this book in 2019, and for some reason it took me about 4 months to realize that this was a translated version. I still have not finished this book, and it would be my goal to finish reading both the English and Indonesian version as soon as I finish reading</font> Kitchen by Banana Yashimoto <font color="Fuchsia">which is so far a really enjoyable read! But yes, getting back to my point...it makes me sad that I have trouble reading Indonesian novels even though it's supposedly my native language.</font>
                <li>Everything I Know About Parties, Dates, Friends, Jobs, Life, Love by Dolly Alderton</li>
                <li>Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer</li>
                <font color="Blue">Sorry not sorry, going off tangent again! I read a lot of different chapters from this book for a (Religion of Trees) class I took last year. VERY INTERESTING. I need to go through a couple more chapters.</font>
                <li>Catatan Seorang Demonstran by Soe Hok Gie</li>
                <li>We Don't Embroider Cushions Here by Augustine and Joseph Rockebrune</li>
                <font color="Fuchsia">My good friend, Shravani recommended this to me! It's currently out of stock, but if you're a fan/not a fan (won't judge either) of Le Corbusier, check it out </font><a href="https://www.printedmatter.org/catalog/44723/">here.</a>
                <li>The Extreme Self by Shumon Basar, Douglas Coupland, Hans Ulrich Obrist</li>
                <font color="blue">*Hans Ulrich Obrist's book called, Ways of Curating, is also really interesting.</font>
                <li>Raving by McKenzie Wark</li>
                <font color="blue">These last two books I found in Spoonbill & Sugartown Books on March 15, 2023. If you haven't noticed, I love trying my best to </font><font color="green">"catalog time".</font>
                <font color="Fuchsia">Also, I started saying the word catalog so many times that it turned to Tagalog.</font>
                <br><br>
